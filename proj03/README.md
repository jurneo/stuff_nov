## **Reference classification with LSTM**

This is the assignment for the DL course part 3 of using LSTM model for solving text classification.

The input is the reference papers database which I have manually label and categorize.

The papers format are in PDF files -- some preprocessing manual and semi-automatic is involved.

The amount of input is not many, I start first with a small amount of dataset.

Update 13/11: two categories at moment Update 28/11: three categories..

There are about 80 documents for each categories with one document is about 5000 words.

For the purpose of testing, I limit first to 1000 words

Reference for this code is from the course as well as [1]
